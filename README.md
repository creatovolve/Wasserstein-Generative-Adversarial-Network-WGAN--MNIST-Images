# Wasserstein-Generative-Adversarial-Network-WGAN--MNIST-Images
Wasserstein GAN for MNIST Image Generation  This repository contains an implementation of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) trained on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The model is implemented in PyTorch and demonstrates stable training of GANs using the Wasserstein distance with weight clipping.

ðŸš€ Features

PyTorch implementation of WGAN (with critic instead of discriminator).

Training on the MNIST dataset (28Ã—28 grayscale images).

Generator & Critic architectures optimized for stable training.

Final trained models are stored in the models/ folder.

Script for generating new digit samples from the trained generator.
